# FireBlaze_Chip8_Emulator_Project
A self-encouraged project. Followed cowgod's chip8 reference and used corax89's chip8 test roms. runs fine. But input is a little bit clunky.


Everything should be set up correctly by default, as it is a visual studio project.

Just clone/download and run on debug mode in visual studio. 

Debug x86 as Win32
